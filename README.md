# 🌀 ZipLink

**ZipLink** is a high-performance, scalable, and distributed URL shortener built with Node.js, Redis, ZooKeeper, and MongoDB. It supports advanced features like:

- One-time links
- Expiry-based short URLs
- Password-protected redirection
- Cached short URLs using Redis
- QR code generation for easy sharing
- Horizontally scalable architecture using distributed ID generation

## 🔗 Architecture Overview

ZipLink follows a distributed system architecture using:

- **ZooKeeper** for consistent, distributed token range allocation.
- **Redis** for caching and rapid short URL lookup.
- **MongoDB** to persist short URL metadata.
- **Express.js** as the backend HTTP server.
- **Next.js** for the frontend (UI).
- **Fast-CSV** for optional bulk input/output.

### 🔗 Flow of Short URL Generation

1. ZooKeeper assigns a unique token range to each backend instance.
2. Tokens are converted to base62 hashes.
3. Metadata is saved to MongoDB and cached in Redis.
4. A QR code is generated for the shortened URL.

### 🔗 Flow of Short URL Redirection

When a user accesses a short URL:

- Redis is checked first for cached metadata.
- If not found, MongoDB is queried and data is cached.
- Password and expiry are validated.
- One-time links are deleted after use.
